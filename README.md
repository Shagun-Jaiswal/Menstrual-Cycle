The dataset was generated from couples in the United States in April 2008 (after 12 cycles of use). The primary goals were to 
1) estimate the fertile window using the Electronic Hormonal Fertility Monitor (EHFM)
and the Cervical Mucus Method (CMM), and to use nonfertile days for
intercourse to avoid conception,and 
2) compare coital frequency between the two Natural Family Planning (NFP) methods.
 
Furthermore, the study excluded women during the first three cycles following the cessation
of breastfeeding, as well as postpartum women and women over the age of 42.

We use this dataset to predict menstrual cycle length. It comprises of
1665 observations and 80 columns, with each row representing a different menstrual cycle observation and each column represents a specific variable.
The dataset includes information from 159 clients, who were divided into
2 groups and monitored using cervical mucus and hormonal monitoring
methods.
